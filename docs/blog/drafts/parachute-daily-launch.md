# Parachute Daily: Start With Your Own Thinking

We might augment our intelligence with new AI tools, but in order to do so well, we need to start with our own intelligence. To write, to think, to explore our own minds—this is the essence of Parachute Daily.

We simply start by writing. Or speaking. Or typing. However we best find ourselves. Let's begin there.

## A Simple Journal

Parachute Daily starts as a simple tool for journaling. One notebook a day, full of many pages; some with nothing but a word, some with a long essay composed within. The goal is not perfection here, but honesty. To bring your thoughts onto the page as clearly as you might.

Sometimes you might wish to press record on a conversation with a friend as you explore some topic together, so that this too might live in your daily journal. The files live on your device and you may do with them as you wish. Any entry can be shared wherever—if you have your own AI tooling you like to think with, bring it there; if you have a friend you'd like to share notes with, share it there.

But Parachute Daily doesn't start as a productivity tool. It starts as a tool for reflection.

## Growing Into It

For those who wish to journal across multiple devices and care to ensure their data is safe and accessible wherever they are, Parachute Daily allows for syncing. We're working to make it affordable, starting at **$1 a month**. This feature is in motion—we're planning to open beta testing for sync next week.

And yes, in this new world, we have these mechanistic intelligences that can complement our thinking, to bring reflections in and extend our minds in different ways than we might be able to on our own. For those who want a taste of AI and how it might enhance the thinking process, the next level of Parachute Daily brings your daily journal entries into relationship with an AI model. It offers reflections each day on your writing, seeking to mirror back to you what is most salient and offer inquiries to help you deepen in your own thinking. This we will offer at **$2 a month**—a way to grow into these new technologies while still honoring the primacy of your own innate intelligence.

From there we expand. At **$5 a month**, you can have not just one agent offering gentle reflections, but up to two agents with simple tool usage—like searching the web to pull in new information. Now you can have an agent that starts every morning with a summary of the news custom to you, or a personalized lesson in a topic of your choice. As we begin to form a knowledge graph that knows you because you trust it to know you, we can start to get information that is immediately relevant. It's not about rushing to have a thousand conversations with ChatGPT every day, but about spending time thinking for ourselves and then leveraging these new technologies to gently extend, augment, and reflect our own thinking.

## Trust and Privacy

If we are to put our own thinking into this space, it's vital that we be able to trust it.

This is why you can start with doing nothing except journaling on your own device. You don't need to store any of your personal entries on a server.

For those who want sync and reflections, we're caring deeply about privacy and security. Your journal entries will be stored on your own private virtual machine in the cloud. End-to-end encryption is planned so that nobody—not even us—has access to your data. And the language models processing your data don't store anything for later training.

For those who want even more assurance, we'll soon be opening beta testing for **Parachute Computer**, which enables you to run everything directly on your own machine so that nothing leaves to any company's servers—not even Parachute's.

## What's Available Now

**Today**, we're opening beta testing for the first wave of Parachute Daily. You can begin using the app to deepen your own journaling process—a space to write and reflect, using whatever medium of expression you prefer.

**Next week**, we're planning to open beta testing for Parachute Daily Sync and Parachute Daily Reflection, allowing you to keep your journal in sync across all your devices.

**Soon after**, we'll open the next level: custom daily agents delivering reflections and reports that help you stay connected, both to yourself and to the world around you.

With Parachute, we want to orient towards a world where we use these new mechanistic intelligences not to replace our thinking but to augment it. And we think that starts with knowing our own minds and our own intelligence.

We hope you'll be with us on this journey.
