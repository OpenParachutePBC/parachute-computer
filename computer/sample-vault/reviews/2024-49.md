# Weekly Review: December 5-6, 2024

## Summary
This week marked the birth of the Obsidian Agent Pilot project—moving from concept to working prototype in just two days. The focus was on building a system where AI agents can autonomously maintain and enhance notes through a declarative, frontmatter-based configuration system. The core insight of "living documents" evolved from research to functional implementation.

## Wins
- **Prototype completed**: Built a working system with Express API, HTML interface, and frontmatter-based agent configuration
- **Architecture clarity**: Decided on hybrid approach (standalone orchestrator + thin plugin client) and chose Claude API first with Agent SDK upgrade path
- **Multi-agent support**: Successfully implemented independent agents per document with separate triggers and statuses
- **Meta-achievement**: The system became operational enough to run its own reflections—theory became practice
- **Research efficiency**: Discovered existing MCP servers for Obsidian integration, avoiding unnecessary reinvention
- **Key insights**: Identified three core capabilities of living documents: responding in voice, self-maintenance, and inter-document connection

## Challenges
- **Scope management**: Resisted over-engineering by starting with Claude API before moving to full Agent SDK
- **Design questions emerging**: Starting to encounter interesting tensions around:
  - When documents should self-modify vs. remain stable
  - Whether agents should collaborate (build on each other's work) or operate independently (each treats original as ground truth)
  - How personality/voice conflicts with user intent should be resolved
- **Testing gaps**: Time-based trigger execution still needs validation in production

## Patterns
- **Build-to-understand philosophy**: Consistently chose prototyping over planning—"the fastest way to understand whether per-document agents make sense was to make one work"
- **Declarative configuration**: Strong preference for frontmatter-based agent definitions that make the system transparent
- **Composability focus**: Moving toward systems where multiple specialized agents can target the same document with different triggers (daily reflection at 10pm + idea curator on-demand + weekly link suggester)
- **Thoughtful gratitude practice**: Each day included intentional reflection on what enabled progress
- **Research → Build → Reflect cycle**: Natural progression from exploration to implementation to synthesis

## Focus for Next Week
- **Trigger system validation**: Test time-based execution in production conditions
- **Permission model**: Develop more sophisticated agent permissions system (who can write where?)
- **Inter-agent communication**: Resolve the design decision between orchestrated collaboration vs. isolated enhancement
- **Design decisions**: Address the tension between document autonomy and user control
- **Edge cases**: Consider implications of document self-modification patterns
- **Documentation**: Capture architectural decisions and patterns discovered during prototyping

## Reflections
The progression from research (Dec 5, 10:00 AM) to working prototype (Dec 6 afternoon) demonstrates remarkable execution velocity. Starting with Claude Agent SDK research, discovering MCP servers, building the prototype, and implementing the orchestration layer—all within 48 hours.

What's particularly notable is the emerging pattern of letting complexity guide the next questions rather than trying to solve everything upfront. The system is now asking better questions: not "can this work?" but "what should it do?" and "how should agents coordinate?"

The project has reached an important inflection point—moving from proof-of-concept to addressing the nuanced design challenges that will determine whether this becomes truly useful or just technically interesting. The shift from "what exists" to "what I can make" reflects disciplined prototyping instincts.

One observation from the daily reflections: there's awareness of meta-closure (the system reflecting on itself) and healthy skepticism about whether multiple agents should be aware of each other's outputs. These are the right tensions to be navigating.
