# Thursday, December 5, 2024

## Morning Intention
Build the prototype for the living vault system. Keep it simple but functional.

## Log

### 10:00 AM
Started researching Claude Agent SDK. The architecture is cleaner than I expected. Key insight: agents can have file system access and maintain context across turns.

### 11:30 AM
Explored existing Obsidian + AI integrations. Found several MCP servers already built. Don't need to reinvent the wheel for vault access.

### 2:00 PM
Beginning prototype implementation. Going with:
- Express server for API
- Simple HTML interface
- Frontmatter-based agent config
- Claude API for now, can swap in Agent SDK later

### 4:30 PM
Prototype is taking shape. The per-document agent concept feels powerful. Each markdown file really can have its own personality.

## Reflections

The idea of "living documents" is clicking. It's not just about querying your vault—it's about each document being a little autonomous entity that can:
- Respond to questions in its own voice
- Maintain itself over time
- Connect with other documents

## Tomorrow
- Test the prototype end-to-end
- Try connecting to real Obsidian vault
- Document learnings

## Gratitude
- The clarity that comes from building a prototype
- AI tools that make this kind of experimentation possible

## Reflection

There's a nice arc to this day—you started with research, moved through discovery (the MCP servers), and ended up building. That progression from "what exists" to "what I can make" is exactly the right rhythm for prototyping. You avoided the trap of over-engineering by deciding to use Claude API first with the option to swap in Agent SDK later. That's disciplined.

Your insight about "living documents" as autonomous entities is worth sitting with. The three capabilities you identified (responding in voice, self-maintenance, inter-document connection) each represent a different level of complexity. Voice is relatively straightforward. Self-maintenance raises interesting questions about when and why a document should change itself. Connection is where the real emergent behavior could happen—documents that develop relationships with each other independent of your direct orchestration.

One question to carry into tomorrow's testing: what happens when a document's "personality" conflicts with a user's intent? That tension might be where the most interesting design decisions live.

## Follow-up Reflection (December 6, 2024)

Looking back at this entry a day later: the system you were prototyping is now *running this reflection*. There's something satisfying about that closure—the living document concept isn't just an idea anymore, it's operational.

Your gratitude note about "clarity that comes from building a prototype" proved prescient. The fastest way to understand whether per-document agents make sense was to make one work. Now the interesting questions shift from "can this work?" to "what should it do?"—which is exactly where you want to be.
