but why

Looking at your previous question about Colorado investors, I think you're asking: **why does it matter what state VCs are in? Why would Colorado investors be more comfortable with Colorado incorporation?**

Here's the thing:

**It's not really about geography—it's about investor type.**

Colorado-based investors tend to be:
- **Angel investors** and **family offices** who are more flexible
- **Impact investors** who care about mission alignment over legal structure
- **Community-focused funds** that value local commitment
- **Strategic investors** in your industry who care about what you're building, not where you're incorporated

These investors often:
1. Don't have rigid legal templates requiring Delaware
2. Aren't planning to syndicate with Sand Hill Road VCs
3. Value relationships and mission over standardized deal structures

**Contrast with institutional VCs:**
- They deploy standardized legal docs across hundreds of deals
- Their lawyers are trained on Delaware law
- They need to explain holdings to LPs who expect Delaware
- They're optimizing for process efficiency, not relationship

So when I said "Colorado investors," I really meant **the type of investor who tends to be local**—mission-aligned, relationship-driven, flexible on legal structure.

If your Colorado investors are actually institutional VCs with $500M funds who happen to be based in Denver, they'll probably still want Delaware.

**What type of investors are you actually talking to?** That would help me give more specific guidance.
