## Conversation

Hello

### para:a3ttriqygj5q Assistant | 2025-12-30T19:59:58.501Z

Hello! I'm your vault agent for Parachute. I can help you think through ideas, find and connect information across your vault, and remember context from past conversations.

This looks like a sample vault, so there may not be much personal content yet. Is there something specific you'd like to explore or work on today?

How many words were in your last message?

### para:rud2yskdqa1z Assistant | 2025-12-30T20:00:14.338Z

My last message contained **46 words**.

### para:zq9d8330b6wb Human | 2025-12-30T20:02:41.251Z

And that message? How many words

### para:ib11izxzv1aq Assistant | 2025-12-30T20:02:41.252Z

That last message contained **6 words**.

### para:aj4v9dteuai3 Human | 2025-12-30T20:03:00.142Z

And if we add those together?

### para:ccn0wd18wrbx Assistant | 2025-12-30T20:03:00.143Z

46 + 6 = **52 words** total.

### para:7sxaovczi3x0 Human | 2025-12-30T20:03:34.328Z

Now double that and subtract 10

### para:q66z89vsrmfm Assistant | 2025-12-30T20:03:34.329Z

52 × 2 = 104
104 - 10 = **94**
