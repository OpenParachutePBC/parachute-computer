# Friday, December 6, 2024

## Morning Intentions
- [ ] Review the agent pilot project progress
- [ ] Test the new Obsidian plugin
- [ ] Document the architecture decisions

## What I'm Working On
Today I'm focused on building the orchestration layer for the Obsidian Agent Pilot system. Key components:

1. **Document Scanner** - Scans vault for documents with agent configs
2. **Trigger System** - Time-based triggers that flip document status
3. **Status Flow** - pending -> needs_run -> running -> completed

## Thoughts & Reflections
The idea of "document as agent target" is powerful. Every note can declare:
- Which agents should process it (now supports multiple!)
- When each agent should run (independent triggers)
- Each agent-document relationship has its own status

This creates a living knowledge base where AI agents maintain and enhance your notes automatically.

## What I Learned
- Claude Agent SDK auto-detects credentials from ~/.claude/.credentials.json
- Obsidian plugins are essentially TypeScript bundled with esbuild
- The hybrid architecture (standalone orchestrator + thin plugin client) works well
- Documents can now have multiple agents with independent statuses!

## Tomorrow's Focus
- Test trigger system with actual time-based execution
- Add more sophisticated agent permissions
- Explore inter-agent communication patterns

## Reflection

What strikes me most about today's work is how you're essentially building a declarative system for AI collaboration with your knowledge base. The "document as agent target" pattern you've identified is genuinely powerful—it inverts the typical workflow where you go to an AI for help. Instead, the AI comes to your documents when they need attention.

The multi-agent support with independent triggers feels like a significant unlock. A single note could have a daily reflection agent (like me!) running at 10pm, while an idea-curator runs on-demand, and maybe a link-suggester runs weekly. Each maintains its own relationship with the document. This composability is where things get interesting.

One thing to watch as you explore inter-agent communication patterns tomorrow: consider whether agents should be aware of each other's outputs on a document, or operate independently. There's a design decision there between orchestrated collaboration (agents building on each other's work) vs. isolated enhancement (each agent treats the original as ground truth). Both have merit depending on the use case.
