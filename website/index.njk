    <section class="section fade-up fade-up-5">
        <h2>What Is Parachute?</h2>
        <p>Parachute is an open-source personal AI platform that runs on your machine. It combines the power of Claude Code, the conversational depth of Claude.ai, and a personal knowledge system&mdash;all in one integrated experience that connects directly with your everyday thinking.</p>
        <p>Instead of scattered tools that forget you exist between sessions, Parachute builds a picture of who you are, what you're working on, and what matters to you. <strong>Instead of you learning the system, the system learns you.</strong></p>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <div class="product">
            <h3>Parachute Computer</h3>
            <p>Your personal AI server. Install it on your machine, a VPS, or a Raspberry Pi. It orchestrates AI agents with three tiers of trust, connects to Telegram and Discord, and keeps everything in your vault&mdash;plain files you own forever.</p>
            <p>If you've used Claude Code, think of this as Claude Code for your whole life, not just your codebase.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="product">
            <h3>Parachute App</h3>
            <p>One app, three core views. <strong>Chat</strong> for AI conversations with full context. <strong>Daily</strong> for voice journaling&mdash;capture thoughts on walks, in the car, wherever you think. <strong>Brain</strong> to search your personal knowledge graph.</p>
            <p>Available on macOS, Android, and web. Daily works offline. Everything else connects to your Parachute Computer.</p>

User -> App (Flutter) -> Parachute Computer -> Claude Agent SDK -> AI

    <!-- Principles -->
    <section class="section">
        <h2>Principles</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Local-first.</strong> Your data lives on your devices in plain files. If we disappeared tomorrow, your notes would still be there, readable in any text editor.</li>
            <li><strong>Voice-first.</strong> Talking is often more natural than typing. We meet people where their thinking actually happens.</li>
            <li><strong>Open source as trust.</strong> The only way to deserve trust with personal thinking is transparency. You can see exactly what the software does.</li>
            <li><strong>AI as partner.</strong> The goal isn't to automate your thinking. It's to help you think more clearly, remember more completely, make connections you might have missed.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Coming Soon</h2>
        <p>Parachute is in active development and approaching a polished public launch. If you want to follow along, the <a href="/roadmap/">roadmap</a> shows exactly where things stand.</p>
        <p>If you're a developer and want to explore the code now, everything is on GitHub. Fair warning: this is pre-launch software&mdash;expect rough edges.</p>
        <div class="product">
            <h3>Explore on GitHub</h3>
            <div class="code-inline">
                <code>git clone https://github.com/OpenParachutePBC/parachute-computer.git</code>
            </div>
            <p>Requires Python 3.11+ and a Claude OAuth token (<code>claude setup-token</code>) for the server. Flutter for the app.</p>
