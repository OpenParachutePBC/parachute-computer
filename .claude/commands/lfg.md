Run these slash commands in order. Each command uses parallel subagents for research and review. Do not do anything else.

1. `/para-plan $ARGUMENTS`
2. `/deepen-plan` — parallel research agents enhance each section
3. `/para-work` — execute the plan efficiently
4. `/para-review` — parallel review agents check all quality dimensions

Start with step 1 now.
